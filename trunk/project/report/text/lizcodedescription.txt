There are three feature classes in our code base:

HaarFeatures.cpp 
This class allows us to extract haar features for a given frame.

EdgeDetectionFeatures.cpp
This class allows us to extract sobel (edge detection) features for a given frame.

Hough.cpp
This class allows us to extract  hough, canary, and harris (circle, line, edge, and corner) features for a given frame.
