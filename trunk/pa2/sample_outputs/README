The format of output files is basically as follows (copied 10 times over, 
once for the ensemble for each digit):

NUM_TREES
TREE_SPECIFICATION*
NUM_HYPOTHESES
HYPOTHESES_WEIGHTS
NUM_EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE_WEIGHTS
DIGIT_LABEL

The tree specification shows the structure of the tree.  Internal nodes labeled I 
indicate what pixelnumber and what threshold they split on.  Leaves labeled L
indicate the count of positive examples out of total examples that reach that leaf.

Note that singletree file for part 2 contains only TREE_SPECIFICATIONS, one for each 
of the classifiers corresponding to the labels 0-9.
